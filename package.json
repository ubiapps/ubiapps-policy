Service station: 2 hours into the journey\r\n\r\n Helen has pulled into a service station for a comfort stop.

Country lane: 3 hours into the journey\r\n\r\n There is only about an hour left, but Eric has become bored to the game and is becoming restless again.  Helen asks Peter to put a video on for Eric.  Peter can’t find anything on Helen’s iMac so selects a video for Peter from his own library.\r\n * From: peter_jones@pzh.webinos.org/PeteriPad\r\n * To: helen_jennings@pzh.webinos.org/HeleniMac\r\n * Resource: http://webinos.org/api/mediacontent\r\n * Environment: Helen Travel\r\n * Expected Result: DENY\r\n\r\n and\r\n * From: helen_jennings@pzh.webinos.org/HelenGalaxyNote\r\n * To: peter_jones@pzh.webinos.org/PeterTV\r\n * Resource: http://webinos.org/api/mediacontent\r\n * Environment: Peter Home\r\n * Expected Result: ALLOW\r\n",
